# I. CATEGORY DEFINITION
# =============================================================================

category:
  name: Ω
  full_name: "Omega - Unified System Modeling Category"
  enrichment: Set
  description: |
    Ω is the categorical fusion of three complementary domains:
    - OPM: Behavior and structure (HOW systems transform)
    - ALTER: Purpose and lifecycle (WHY systems exist, FOR WHOM)
    - COMN: Meaning and data (WHAT things are, semantically)

    Ω is constructed as the PULLBACK of these three categories over
    a shared Base category of fundamental system concepts.

  construction:
    type: "Pullback (Fibered Product)"

      Ω ──π_O──→ OPM

           U_A         U_C
    universal_property: |
      For any category X with functors f_O: X→OPM, f_A: X→ALTER, f_C: X→COMN
      such that U_O∘f_O = U_A∘f_A = U_C∘f_C,
      there exists a unique functor h: X→Ω making all squares commute.

# =============================================================================
# XIII. EMERGENT PROPERTIES (Exclusive to Ω)
# =============================================================================

emergent_properties:
  description: |
    These properties ONLY exist in Ω and cannot be expressed in any single domain.
    They emerge from the INTERACTION of the three domains.

  properties:
    - id: Ω-E1_Purposeful_Behavior
      name: "Purposeful Behavioral Semantics"
      formula: "OPM.Process + ALTER.Value + COMN.Predicate"
      description: |
        A process in Ω simultaneously:
        - HAS behavioral dynamics (states, transitions) [OPM]
        - CREATES value for beneficiaries [ALTER]
        - INSTANTIATES a semantic predicate [COMN]
        No single domain captures all three aspects.
      example: |
        "Evaluar IPR" in Ω is:
        - OPM: Process transforming IPR from 'pendiente' to 'evaluado'
        - ALTER: Activity creating 'transparency value' for 'Ciudadanía'
        - COMN: Predicate "IPR es_evaluado_por Evaluador en Fecha"

    - id: Ω-E2_Typed_Value_Flow
      name: "Semantically Typed Value Chains"
      formula: "ALTER.ValueChain + COMN.Type"
      description: |
        Value flows in Ω are TYPED, preventing semantic inconsistencies.
        ALTER alone has value chains but no type system.
        COMN alone has types but no value orientation.
      example: |
        Value delivered must match expected type:
        - Beneficiary expects "ReporteIPR" (COMN type)
        - WS delivers "ReporteIPR" instance (typed value)

    - id: Ω-E3_Stateful_Work_Systems
      name: "Work Systems with Explicit State Machines"
      formula: "ALTER.WorkSystem + OPM.StateModel"
      description: |
        Work Systems in Ω have EXPLICIT state machines, not just health indicators.
        ALTER alone has WS health (operating/degraded/failed).
        OPM alone has object states but no organizational context.
      example: |
        Ω-System "Gestión IPR":
        - WS health: operating (ALTER)
        - Process state: "evaluación" (OPM)
        - Object states: {borrador, evaluación, aprobado, ...} (OPM)

    - id: Ω-E4_Semantic_Workarounds
      name: "Workarounds with Type Safety"
      formula: "ALTER.Workaround + COMN.TypeCheck"
      description: |
        Emergent changes in Ω preserve type constraints.
        ALTER alone accepts workarounds without semantic validation.
        COMN alone has no concept of emergent change.
      example: |
        A workaround in Ω:
        - Must still produce correctly-typed outputs
        - Variation tracked as 2-cell between typed processes

    - id: Ω-E5_Multi_Level_Lifecycle
      name: "Unified Conceptual-Logical-Operational Lifecycle"
      formula: "COMN.Levels + OPM.Refinement + ALTER.WSLC"
      description: |
        Ω-WSLC unifies three originally separate progressions:
        - COMN: Conceptual → Logical → Physical
        - OPM: SD → SD1 → SD2 ... (refinement)
        - ALTER: Initiation → Development → Implementation → Operation
      categorical: "These are now a SINGLE coherent path in Ω"

    - id: Ω-E6_Trimodal_Constraints
      name: "Cross-Domain Constraint Checking"
      formula: "Ω-Axioms across π_O, π_A, π_C"
      description: |
        Ω can enforce constraints that span domains:
        - "Every process creating value (ALTER) must have typed output (COMN)"
        - "Every dynamic object (OPM) must belong to a WS element (ALTER)"
        - "Every FK (COMN) must correspond to a structural link (OPM)"
      categorical: "Naturality conditions of pullback"

    - id: Ω-E7_Purpose_Driven_Refinement
      name: "Refinement Guided by Value"
      formula: "OPM.Refinement + ALTER.ValueContribution"
      description: |
        In Ω, when refining (in-zoom), each sub-process INHERITS value contribution.
        Pure OPM refinement is value-agnostic.
        This ensures no "orphan" sub-processes without purpose.

    - id: Ω-E8_Semantic_System_Diagram
      name: "System Diagram with Full Typing"
      formula: "OPM.SD + COMN.Schema"
      description: |
        Ω-SD is an OPM System Diagram where:
        - Every object is typed (COMN)
        - Every state has a value domain (COMN)
        - Every link corresponds to a relationship type (COMN)
      utility: "Diagrams are executable specifications, not just pictures"
